<center>

</center>

A simple Steemit extension that shows more info on steemit.com

If you use steemit.com, you may have notice that it is lacking a lot of functionalities.
That's why you need to use tools like https://steemd.com/, https://steemdb.com/, https://steemstats.com/, https://www.steemnow.com/, ...
A lot of tools!

**_So why another tool???_**
Because this is a Chrome and Firefox extension that you install on your browser, and then **all the informations you need will be available to you directly on steemit.com!**


_Please take into consideration that this is a new project that I just started, and the features are limited to just a few so far! I'm planning to add more and more features in the next versions. Every suggestion and idea is very much appreciated!_


### This is version 1.2 with some bug fixes and a few ![new](https://i.imgsafe.org/65/655926ba30.png) features added

  By clicking on one of the bars, you can **open the list of posts made on one specific date**. This makes it easier to look at old posts of an user!

  You can choose to **show the histogram automatically on page load** (_default_) or if you prefer to load the histogram on request if you find it to be too invasive. To change this setting, hover on the histogram title and select "On load: hidden"

---

* The **followers and following pages have been updated** to show a table of the followers/following, with more informations (**Reputation, STEEM Power, Upvote Worth**). You can **sort** by the different attributes by clicking on the table's column.

## Future development

I'm planning to add more features like:
* COMING SOON: Trending of up to 5 favorite tags in one page. You select your favorite tags and you'll see the list of the top trending of all the tags combined in one list. I'm not releasing this feature yet because it still has some bugs. 
* Notifications, for instance if somebody replies on one of your posts or comments, if you get an upvote, ...
* A page with some graphs of the stats of the account 
* Working on my own API, such as _mentions notification_, _followers by date_ of follow operation, posts _reposted_ by others, ...
* Something about GIF ;)
* ...

## Privacy - Do I steal your data?

**I do not access your private keys**. The only way I could do it, is if you go to your wallet page and click on "show private key". But I don't do it!
Should you trust me? Well, I believe is better not to trust anyone. That's why the source code of the extension is available on github and you can (and you are encourage to) look and study it!

The way it works is by scraping the webpage and the url of the page you are looking at to extract your username and the username of the user you are looking at. Then it uses steem-js to get informations about that user. 
This process doesn't involve any private key! In fact, you can see informations of other users as well, even if you obbiuvsly don't know their private keys.
